# Summary

Before creating this repository, I've evaluated following XMPP libraries for PHP:

* https://github.com/nikita2206/Xmpp
* https://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/ ( A better fork can be found at https://github.com/charlycoste/xmpphp )
* https://github.com/jaxl/JAXL

Unfortunately, none of above ships with what I need. That's the reason I'm creating this repository based on nikita2206's work.

This repository currently is not ready for public use.
